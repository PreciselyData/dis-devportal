# Geocode API for Snowflake

The Geocode API for Snowflake is a middleware that provides a platform for a Snowflake user to utilize the Precisely APIs and perform operations like geocoding, verifying addresses, and data enrichment. This API helps Snowflake users use their External User Defined Functions (UDFs) and integrate with any external API gateway exposed through AWS/Azure/GCP.
